# HMMGeneFinder
A Hidden Markov Model to identify coding regions and genes in sequences of E.Coli DNA

----

### Description
The HMM takes in an input E.Coli DNA Sequence and identifies Gene Coding regions of DNA, employing the Viterbi algorithm and other probabilistic dynamically programmed techniques. 

### Using the HMM
